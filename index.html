								<h2>Education:</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Undergrad (2011-2015):</b> I majored in Chemistry and Biology at the Massachussetts Institute
										of Technology (MIT) where I participated in the UROP program primarily from <a href="https://web.mit.edu/johnsongroup/">Prof. Jeremiah
											Jonhson's Lab</a>. I worked mostly on the synthesis of building blocks for drug-carrying
											polymers designed primarily for drug-delivery applications. The main skills I gained were
											small molecule syntehsis, polymer synthesis and polymer analysis.
									</li>
									<li><b>Graduate I (2016-2019):</b> This refers to part 1 of my PhD which I did at Stanford Univeristy
										in <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/khosla/cgi-bin/">Prof. Chaitan Khosla's Lab</a>. I spent 3 years
										in this lab focused on 3 projects centered around DEBS, the canonical polyketide synthase: (1) I
										studied the conformational changes of a DEBS module using FRET hoping to identify distinct catalytic
										states, (2) I studied the structure of hybrid DEBS module constructs to pin down interactions between
										module proteins, and (3) I studied small molecule activators of DEBS turnover. The main skills I gained were
										protein biochemistry (from cloning to protein expression to activity assay), FRET, protein cystrallography adding
										protein structure analysis.
									</li>
									<li><b>Graduate II (2019-2022):</b> This refers to part 2 of my PhD which was still at Stanford University but
									in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html">Prof. Michael Snyder's Lab</a>. I spent 3 years generating and 
								analyzing multi-omic data for patients that had undergone a living-donor liver transplant and developed a rare post-operative
							condition called Segmental Graft Dysfunction. I used mass spectrometry profiled sick and healthy patient sera and generated proteomic,
						lipidomic and metabolomic data which was all complemented with demographic and clinical information. The main skills I gaiend were mass spectrometry
					data generation and analysis (from sample prep to batch correction to differential expression), multi-omic data integration, linear model based differential 
				abundance, pathway analysis, and mortality prediction.</li>
									<li><b>Graduate III (2012-Pesent):</b> </li>
